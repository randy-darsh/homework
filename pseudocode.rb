# BIG PICTURE: to try to manipulate/annoy the answer of the user to be "GOODBYE!" and then "GOODBYE!" again

# the interface will be a simple prompt to enter text.

# first it needs to prompt the users input.

"HELLO, THIS IS A GROCERY STORE!"

# user will input (most likely) at least 1 lowercase letter.

# 1 lowercase letter returns:

"I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."

# ALL CAPS will return

"NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE."

# and if they input nothing it will prompt them with a nice

"HELLO?!"

# at this point they will want to quit and to quit they must enter "GOODBYE!" twice in a row.

# first response

"ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP YOU WITH?"

# second response

"THANK YOU FOR CALLING!"

end
